# shinyeippd42ns
This code was modified from Matthew Schroyner's code.

One major change with this code was the change of threshhold voltage by using a resistor across Pin 5 on the senor and reading off of P2 (pin 2) on the sensor instead of the P1 (pin 4).

Code used to create a PM2.5 sensor with a shinyei ppd42ns and a photon

This code is the code used for the PM 2.5 sensor project that is described at
